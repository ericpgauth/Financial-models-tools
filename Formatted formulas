  `Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε`  
  where `Y` is the dependent variable, `X` is the independent variable, `β₀` is the intercept, `β₁` is the slope coefficient, and `ε` is the error term.

- **Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression:**
  - Linearity: A linear relationship exists between the dependent and independent variables.
  - Homoscedasticity: The variance of the error term is constant across observations.
  - Independence: The error terms are uncorrelated across observations.
  - Normality: The error term is normally distributed.

- **Total Sum of Squares (TSS):**  
  `TSS = Σ(Y_i - Ȳ)²`  
  where `Y_i` are the observed values and `Ȳ` is the mean of `Y`.

- **Regression Sum of Squares (RSS):**  
  `RSS = Σ(Ŷ_i - Ȳ)²`  
  where `Ŷ_i` are the predicted values.

- **Error Sum of Squares (SSE):**  
  `SSE = Σ(Y_i - Ŷ_i)²`

- **Coefficient of Determination (R²):**  
  `R² = RSS / TSS`  
  which represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.

- **Standard Error of the Estimate (S_e):**  
  `S_e = √(SSE / (n - 2))`

- **F-Statistic:**  
  `F = (RSS / k) / (SSE / (n - k - 1))`  
  where `k` is the number of independent variables. A significant F-statistic indicates that the regression model provides a better fit than a model with no independent variables.

- **t-Statistic for Slope Coefficient:**  
  `t = (β̂₁ - β₁) / S_β̂₁`  
  where `β̂₁` is the estimated slope coefficient and `S_β̂₁` is its standard error.

- **t-Statistic for Intercept Coefficient:**  
  `t = (β̂₀ - β₀) / S_β̂₀`  
  where `β̂₀` is the estimated intercept and `S_β̂₀` is its standard error.

- **Prediction Interval:**  
  `Ŷ ± t_{α/2} * S_f`  
  where `S_f = S_e * √(1 + 1/n + (X_f - X̄)² / Σ(X_i - X̄)²)` and `t_{α/2}` is the critical value from the t-distribution.

# Economics

- **Price Elasticity of Demand:**  
  `(%ΔQ / %ΔP) = (P₀ / Q₀) * (ΔQ / ΔP)`  
  where `ΔQ / ΔP` is the slope coefficient. Demand is elastic if the absolute value is greater than 1; inelastic if less than 1.

- **Income Elasticity of Demand:**  
  `(%ΔQ / %ΔI) = (I₀ / Q₀) * (ΔQ / ΔI)`  
  where `ΔQ / ΔI` is the slope coefficient. A positive value indicates a normal good; a negative value indicates an inferior good.

- **Cross Elasticity of Demand:**  
  `(%ΔQ / %ΔP_c) = (P_c / Q₀) * (ΔQ / ΔP_c)`  
  where `P_c` is the price of the competing good. A positive value indicates a substitute good; a negative value indicates a complementary good.
