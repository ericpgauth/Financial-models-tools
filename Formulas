Gross domestic product (GDP) 
   Expenditure approach = comsumption + investment + Gov spending+ net exports
   Income approach = Household income + business income + Gov income
   Value-added approach = Sum incremental value-added at each stage of production
Nominal GDP = Pt * Qt
Real GDP = Pb * Qt where b = base year price
GDP Deflator = (value of current year output at current prices / value of current year output at base year prices) * 100
National Income, personal income, and personal disposible income
   National Income = Compensation of employees + Corp & govt profits before taxes + Interest income + unincorporated buss net income + rent + indirect buss taxes less subsidies
   Personal income = National income - indirect business taxes - corporate income taxes - undistrobuted corp frofit + transfer payments
   Personal disposable income = personal income - personal taxes
Aggregate deman - shifts due to changes in household wealth, consumer and =business expectations, capacity utilization, monetary policy, fiscal policy, exchange rates, and foreign GDP
Aggregate supply - Short-Run Shifts: Changes in changes in potential GDP, nominal wages, input prices, future price expectations, business taxes and subsidies and exchange rate
Aggregate supply - Lon-run shifts: changes in labor supply, supply of physical and human capital and productivity and technology
Growth Accounting Equation: Growth in potential GDP = Growth in technology + WL (Growth in labor) + Wc (growth in capital)
Business cycle phases: Trough (lowest); expansion; peak (highest); contraction
Economic indicators 
   Leading: Turn ahead of peaks and troughs of business cycle (S&P500, manufacturing new order, building permits)
   Coincidental: Turns coincide with phase of business cycle (employee payrolls, manufacturing sales, personal income)
   Lagging: Turns after the business cycle movements (average prime rate, inventory-sales ratio, duration of unemployment)

Types of unemployment
   Frictional: unemployment from time lag to find new job
   cyclical: unemployment due to business cycle fluctuations
   Structural: unemployment due to lack of skills for job openings or distance factors
Consumer price index: CPI = (Cost of basket at current prices / cost of basket at base period prices ) *100
Monetary Policy: Central bank activities that influence the supply of money and credit; expansionary when policy rate < neitral interest rate; contractionary when policy rate > neutral interest rate
Central bank objectives: Full employment and price stability
Money multiplier = 1/reserve requirement
Fiscal policy: govt decisions about taxation and spending; expansionary when govt budget balance decreasing; contractionary when gocvt budget balance increasing
Fiscal multiplier = 1/ (1-MPC(1-t)
Equation of Exchange: M * V = P * Y

   GNP Final value of goods and services produced by citizens of a country/economy
Regional Trading Agreements (RTA)
   Free trade areas (FTA): Trade barriers removed amoug members; countries still have own policies against non-members
   Customs Union: FTA with common policy against non-members
   Common Market: Customs union with free movement of factors of production amoung members
   Economic Union: All aspects of common market with common economic institutoins and economic policy
   Monetary Union: If members of ecnomic union adopt a common currency
Balance of Payments
   Current account: measures flow of goods and sevices (merchange trade, services, income receipts, unilateral transfers)
   Capital account: measures transfers of capital (capital transfers, sales & purchases of non-produced, non-financial assets)
   Financial Account: Records incevestment flows (financial asserts abroad, foreign-owned financial assets)

Real exchange rate (d/f) = Spot rate(d/f) * CPI Foreign/CPI domestic
Change in Nominal exchange rate: Δexchange rate (d/f) = (spot rate (d/f) at the end of the period/spot rate d/f at the beginning)-1
Change in Real exchange rate: ΔReal d/f = (1+(ΔSd/f)/(Sd/f)) * ((1+ΔPf/Pf)/ (1+ΔPd/Pd)) - 1
Forward discount/premium = Forward( rate (d/f) / Spot rate d/f)-1
No-arbitrage forward exchange rate = spot rate (d/f) * [(1+ domestic int rate *(actual/360))/(1+foreign int rate)*(actual/360)]
Exchange rate regimes
   Monetary Union: Members adopt common currency
   Dollarization: Members adopt foreign currency
   Fixed parity: +/-1 percent around the parity level
   Target zone: up to 2+/- percent around the parity level
   Crawling Peg: Pegged exchange rate periodically adjusted
   Managed Float: Central bank acts to influence exchange rate without a specific target
   Independent Float: Exchange rate freely determine by the market.
